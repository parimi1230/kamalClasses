:
----------------
- James Gosling
- Biggest advantage - Platform independent - achieved with .class file.

- Program - how it compiles, how it runs
class, Object
- OOPS concepts
    - Inheritence - Need to notes
	- Polymorphism - Added Done.
	- abstraction - 
	- Encapsulation
	- Aggregation
	- Composition

    - Interfaces
	- abstract classes and methods
- Datatypes.	
- default, private, protected, public.
- static, final
- How to work with conditions
- loops
- Switch statements
- Exception Handling
- Multi Threading
- Collections framework.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Class - 
  action - driving - method
  properties - variables. - ex. music, steering, type of gear.
  
Dog - bark, swinging of tail - method
properties - tail, legs, eyes


- Object. - Instance of a class. - new 


How it compiles :

hardware
-----
OS
----
JVM
----
java

compiling a program:
---------------------
javac filename

Running a program:
--------------------
java className

Java Helloworld sample:
String args[] - To read command line arguments.

Class: - Always it should be noun
Method - Always it should be verb.
-----------------

Compile Time Polymorphism   
-----------------------------------
Same Method name with different parameters.-Key1
The linking will happen while compiling. - Key2
this is also called method overloading

Runtime Polymorphism
------------------------
Runtime polimorphism will happen in case of parent child relationship.
This will have Same method signature.
The linking will happen at runtime.

Abstraction:
--------------
Hiding unnecessary details to the end user. Ex: car - Steering, Gearbox and ABC are interfaces.
Abstraction in java can be achieved via abstract methods, interfaces.

Abstract methods:
   public void abstractmethod();

Class GoogleApis
  - fetch mails from gmail. public void fetchGmailInfo(){ }
  - get photos from drive.
  - get docs from google docs.
  
class yahooAPI extends GoogleApis
   - fetch mail from yahooAPI - public void fetchGmailInfo(){ hit yahoomail and fetch data}
